trakt-bot2
==========

irc bot for trakt, posts new entries from the friends stream automatically.

* create new trakt account, add all of the people you want to get notifications for as friends.
* install cinch, edit the defines in bot.rb.
* run in a screen or whatever.

very hacky (i suck at ruby), but it works.
